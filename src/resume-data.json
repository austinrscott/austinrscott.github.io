I hadn't completed anything using React before I did this project. It took me 5-6 hours of research and tutorials, 3 hours to design the graphics, and about another 6 hours of coding to get the page done. I used Adobe Illustrator for the layout and PyCharm as my IDE."

After the shipping has been done, the shipping receipt is scraped to provide the script with tracking numbers matched to their corresponding ZIP codes. Lastly, the program uses these ZIP codes to match the tracking number with the order, mark the order as 'Completed' using the REST API, and then sends the customer a note with their tracking information."

As such, their vendors have no APIs in place or anything to automate the data access. Universal Motorsports has been established for several years and they have a big volume of sales. I used Python to create a dashboard with Tk. I studied the vendor websites and created a modular design, whereby I'd be able to write detailed implementations for each vendor's Selenium scraping process and produce the data in a uniform fashion. After the program goes and finds tracking numbers, it outputs a .CSV file which is ready to be imported into ShipStation and notifies the client."

So in 2017 I made plans to go on a hiatus, establish a temporary studio in my home state, and get my first piece of major work done. I was in control of the work throughout the entire process of writing, recording, mixing and mastering, and I didn't outsource any of it. I am proud of the audio quality, but I look forward to making more albums with more focused energy â€” this one takes a lot of detours and is rather scattered."

Much of my work has involved drawing detailed to-scale images of the potential future locations, and creating an inventory list of all furniture with its sizing. I created a physical model of the office to aid in the planning and design."
