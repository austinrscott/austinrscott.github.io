## About Me

> I firmly believe that as long as you can put your mind to something, it can be done. 

A wise person once told me a parable: "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time." That's how I approach most thingsâ€”one bite
at a time. It's how I've been able to learn such a broad set of skills. My passion is in delivering a magical blend of
technology and art; I want to create tools and experiences that are life-changing, improving the world and enabling the
next generation of pioneers to build even greater things.
