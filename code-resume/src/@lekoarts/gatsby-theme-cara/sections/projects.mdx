<u>Universal Power Sports</u> is an eCommerce business in San Diego, CA. In 2018, they hired me as a <b>Freelance Developer</b>.
Many of their vendors have old websites and no API access. I created a Python app which automates a browser, logs into
their vendors' websites, scrapes necessary shipment tracking data, and creates a .CSV file which they can import into ShipStation.
The software features a GUI. This tool reduced their weekly labor spent on this task from 30 hours to 5.<br />
